									<p>The examination of this elective was split in two parts The first part consisted of 9 topics with tasks, which was done in groups. The second part was individual presentations of 6 topics (listen above).</p>
									<p>The materials for the first part of the exam will not be uploaded as they were made in groups and therefore not mine to share. The second part is on the other hand available below in PPTX format.</p>
									<p>Feel free to use the slides for non-profit educational purposes, of course. I don't claim to own all the images from the slides, as I have used various images from the internet. With that said, I also have made most of the diagrams through Diagram.io, which I recommend.</p>

									<dt>Risk assessment</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Risk assessment is a process used to identify potential hazards, analyse the probability
											for it to happen and the consequences that might follow. We then determine measures to
											prevent or minimise the impact.
											
											There are different ways we can deal with these risk factors. There are proactive and
											reactive risk strategies, which one can follow to deal with these risk factors. One reactive
											risk strategy is known as the “Indiana Jones Strategy”, which is the approach of dealing
											with issues once they occur rather than identifying and dealing with them from an early
											stage.
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Risk Matrix</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Risk assessment matrices can help us visualise and
											categorise risks in different Criticality Levels depending
											on their. These risks are put into a table</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Usability Testing</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Usability testing is done by real-life users, who reveal issues that people familiar with
											a product can not identify. The users are usually observed by researchers, marketers
											or by product owners. The primary focus of usability testing is to achieve goals with
											effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specific context. To perform a usability
											test properly, following usability components should be satisfied.
										</p>
										<ul class="alt">
											<li>Satisfaction: Users understand how the site works and don't get 'lost' or feel
												confused and enjoy using it.</li>
											<li>Learnability: Users can complete the main actions without any help.</li>
											<li>Efficiency: Users can have a functional and efficient experience.</li>
											<li>Recoverability: Users should be able to continue and complete the work after
												encountering an error.</li>
											<li>Errors: UI should be clear and easy enough so that the user can complete their
												tasks with few errors or mistakes.</li>
											<li>Memorability: If the user is able to use the product again after not having
												used it for a period of time Efficiency.</li>
										</ul>
											
									
									</dd>
									<dt>Black-box</dt>
									<dd>
										<p> is a software testing method that is used to evaluate the functionality of the
											software without looking at the internal components / structure. Black-box testing can be
											applied to all phases / levels of testing, fx. Acceptance testing, integration testing, unit
											testing, etc.
											When we do black-box testing, we focus solely on the performance of the specified
											application / product. This is done to ensure that the software functions as expected.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Equivalence Partitioning</dt>
									<dd>
										<p> is a black box testing technique where we divide the test conditions
											into groups. We then take one condition from each group and perform a test on it. If that
											specific condition passes our test, we will then assume that the remaining conditions in that
											group work as well.
											This technique has many benefits such as it reduces lots of rework while providing us with
											decent test coverage. It also saves a lot of time by reducing the number of test cases.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Boundary Value Analysis</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Boundary value testing goes hand in hand with equivalence partition testing. The goal is to
											test the values near boundaries of the partitions from the equivalence partition testing.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Decision Table</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Decision tables (DTT) are used to list the input conditions of the system followed by the
											actions that correspond. We put this data into tables and can thereby get a decent overview of
											each possible condition and action.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>State Transition Diagram</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Is a black box testing technique in which if we make changes in the input conditions it will
											cause state changes or output changes in the Application. State-transition diagrams describe
											all of the states that an object can have:

											<ul class="alt">
												<li>1. State is a condition of an object during its life in which the object satisfies some
													condition, performs some action, or waits for some event.</li>
												<li>2. The events under which an object changes state are called transitions.</li>
												<li>3. The conditions that must be fulfilled before the transition will occur are called guards,
													it is a Boolean expression which, if true, enables an event to cause a transition.</li>
												<li>4. The activities undertaken during the life of an object are called actions.</li>
												<li>5. State transition testing helps us to analyze behavior of an application for different
													input conditions. We can provide positive or negative input test values and record the
													system behavior.</li>
												<li>6. Event is an occurrence that may trigger a state transition. Event types include an
													explicit signal from outside the system, an invocation from inside the system, the
													passage of a designated period of time, or a designated condition becoming true.</li>
											</ul>

									<dt>White-Box</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>[To-be-added]</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Pseudo-code</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Pseudocode generally does not actually obey the syntax rules of any particular language there is no
											systematic standard form. Depending on the writer, pseudocode may vary widely in style, from a
											near-exact imitation of a real programming language at one extreme, to a description approaching
											formatted prose at the other.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Statement Coverage</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Statement testing is a popular white-box testing technique that is used to design test cases and
											achieve test coverage. When aiming for full statement coverage in a test, all statements of the source
											code need to be executed at least once. By doing so, we can use the data to calculate the total
											number of executed statements versus the total number of statements presented in the source code.
											To calculate statement coverage, we can use the following formula:
											<br><br>
											Statement Coverage = Number of executed statements / Total number of statements * 100
											<br><br>
											The formula above will give us the Statement coverage percentage value.
											This technique falls under the testing phase in the SDLC.
											When performing a statement coverage test, the following steps should be applied:
											
											<ul class="alt">
												<li>1. Examination of the complete functionalities of the program.</li>
												<li>2. Collection and documentation of statements through the source code.</li>
												<li>3. Verification of all the statements from step nr. 2.</li>
											</ul>
											
											
											
											
											By following the previously mentioned steps, we can ensure that we have done proper statement
											coverage. With that said, there are of course some advantages and disadvantages for this technique.
											<br><br>
											<ul class="alt">
												<li>- Reduces the amount of unused / unnecessary code.</li>
												<li>- Can help improve the performance of the software.</li>
												<li>- Helps with maintaining and managing the quality of the software.</li>
											</ul>
											Some disadvantages are as followed:
											<br><br>
											<ul class="alt">
												<li>Can be costly if implemented late (usually if not implemented in the planning phase)</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Decision Coverage</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Decision coverage also falls under white-box testing. This technique uses control flow graphs or
											charts to cover all possible outcomes of every single Boolean condition in the code . In other words, it
											is used every time there is a Decision point with two or more outcomes of True or False, such as
											if/else, do, while and switch case statements. Each decision point must be executed to achieve full
											decision coverage.
											<br>

											To calculate the decision coverage, we can use the following formula:
											<br><br>
											Decision Coverage = Number of decision outcomes exercised / Total number of decision outcomes * 100

											<br><br>
											The formula will give us the Decision Coverage percentage value.
											When performing a decision coverage test, following steps should be applied:
											<ul class="alt">
												<li>1. Scanning the code end to end and finding the decision indicators in the code</li>
												<li>2. Create flowchart in order to visualize the results or outcomes of the different decisions in the
													code.</li>
												<li>3. Evaluating the logical decisions from the previous step.
													<li>3.1. Includes verifying and validating the logics</li>
													<li>3.2. If end results match planned results: Evaluation → Success
														<li>3.2.1. Should meet the data from the client in form of Functional Specification
															Testing</li>
													</li>
												</li>
											</ul>
												
											<br>
											By following the previously mentioned steps, we ensure that we have done the decision coverage
											testing properly. There are of course also some advantages and disadvantages to this testing
											techniques:
											<br>
											Advantages for Decision Coverage:
											<br><br>
											<ul class="alt">
												<li>- Keep track if there are unfinished or unused code / functionalities in the code</li>
												<li>- Evaluates the complete code and its performance by testing if the functionality meets the
													client’s requirements</li>
												<li>- Encourages maintainability of the program’s quality and the logical decisions in it.</li>
											</ul>
											Disadvantages:
											<ul class="alt">
												<li>- Needs additional efforts from the development team and testing professionals</li>
											</ul>
											All in all, the statement and decision code coverage techniques are powerful testing techniques and
											bring many benefits to the testing of an application. They ensure that each statement is tested
											properly and that the requirements set by the client are met.
											<br>
											Benefits of Full Test Coverage:
											The reason why we do test coverage is that we get better quality code in the long run in comparison
											to the partial code coverage, not the other way around. There’ll probably be less dead code
											afterwards – unless you like to write tests for dead code. Test coverage results in better structure and
											cleaner code as well as they provide fewer use of anti patterns..
											In order to achieve full coverage for our system, we need to calculate the minimum number of paths
											that provide 100% coverage of statements and also decisions. The minimum paths for full statement
											coverage do not necessarily provide full decision coverage but full decision coverage implies full
											statement coverage.

									<dt>Test Case Design</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Test case designs are used to make sure that the tests for a specified system are designed
											properly. It is essential that tests for a system are designed well in order to identify bugs,
											defects or other hazards in the software while performing the testing. The risks of poorly
											designed test cases can be that critical bugs or defects may go undetected during the tests.
											Test case design includes various techniques, which can be used to create proper testing
											suites. There are three three major categories in test case designing. These categories are the
											following:
											<ul class="alt">
												<li>- Specification based (black-box).</li>
												<li>- Structure-based (white-box).</li>
												<li>- Experience-based.</li>
											</ul>

											In order to perform a specification based test case design on a system, one must ensure to follow the three main steps:
											<br><br>
											<ul class="alt">
												<li>1. Specify test procedures.</li>
												<li>2. Identify test conditions.</li>
												<li>3. Specify test cases.</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
											
									</dd>
									<dt>Test Procedure</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Test procedure is a sequence of actions for the execution of a test.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Test Conditions</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Test conditions specify an item, event or components of a given software that can be verified
											by a test or set of test cases. They act as rules that should be followed in order to test certain
											functionalities.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Test Cases</dt>
									<dd>
										<p> Test cases act as the starting point for the test execution process. After applying a set of input
											values, the application has a definitive outcome and leaves the system at some endpoint - also
											known as execution postcondition.</p>
